//this script is about how to create a veriable and makes an object to show a message with the value of your variable

//how to create a variable ---> variablename = value ---> automatic declaration and defination ---> not the best for me but still ok

myfirstname = "Bence";

//show_message() function is similar as the Console.WriteLine() in C# or the print in lua or python

show_message("Hello my name is " + myfirstname);
